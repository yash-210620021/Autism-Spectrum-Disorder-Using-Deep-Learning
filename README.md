# Autism Spectrum Disorder Detection Using Deep Learning

## Introduction

This repository contains the mini-project **"Autism Spectrum Disorder Detection Using Deep Learning"**, developed collaboratively as part of our coursework. The project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Non-ASD cases with high accuracy.

## Project Highlights

The project involved training and fine-tuning state-of-the-art CNN architectures to achieve the following validation accuracies:
- **VGG16**: 93.75%
- **VGG19**: 96.00%
- **VGGFaces**: 92.50%
- **Inception V3**: 97.50%
- **ResNet50**: 97.50%

## Dataset and Model Links

- [Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dCETVruQn4EZJash14C_Tv-aHfBFCo-e?usp=sharing): The dataset consists of images categorized into two classes: ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) and NASD (Non-Autism Spectrum Disorder).
- [Saved Models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZHJBVKQJ1__zpHkbrbjB8J5F08ge8Wp7?usp=sharing): Pre-trained models for each architecture.

## Repository Structure

- `code/`: Contains Python scripts for training and evaluating the models.
- `data/`: Placeholder directory for storing dataset files.
- `models/`: Placeholder directory for saving trained models.
- `resources/`: Documentation and project reports.

## Usage

To use this repository:
1. Download the dataset from the [Dataset Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dCETVruQn4EZJash14C_Tv-aHfBFCo-e?usp=sharing) and place it in the `data/` directory.
2. Use the [Saved Models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZHJBVKQJ1__zpHkbrbjB8J5F08ge8Wp7?usp=sharing) or train the models yourself using the scripts in the `code/` folder.
3. Follow the instructions in the code folder to set up the environment and run the models.
4. Experiment with different configurations to reproduce or improve the results.
